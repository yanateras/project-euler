# Project Euler

![Profile image](https://projecteuler.net/profile/yanalunaterra.png)

My solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) in üê∫ [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/), also known as Mathematica.

If you want to be my friend, here's my friend code: `1086062_YOpW9YjXoXYpJMO5qY5E0EgTf7qs4a2s`

## Problems

- [Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5](problem_001/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers](problem_002/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 3: Largest prime factor](problem_003/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 4: Largest palindrome product](problem_004/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 5: Smallest multiple](problem_005/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 6: Sum square difference](problem_006/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 7: 10001st prime](problem_007/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- Problem 8: Largest product in a series
- [Problem 9: Special Pythagorean triplet](problem_009/) ‚úîÔ∏è
- [Problem 10: Summation of primes](problem_010/) ‚úîÔ∏è

## Instructions

You'll need WolframScript. It comes with Mathematica or Wolfram Engine. It's all bundled with [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), if you happen to use it.
Alternatively, these packages work too (free, limited use):

- [Wolfram Engine for desktop](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) (Linux x86-64, macOS, Windows)
- [Mathematica for Raspberry Pi](https://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi/) (Linux AArch32)

Please note that all of this is very proprietary~

Once you have set it all up and `wolframscript -help` works, you can execute the solutions!
For example, to see the answer for problem 10, run `./problem_010/solution.wls`.
